# Road_Accident_Analysis
Power BI and Excel Dashboard

📌 **Project Overview**
An end-to-end Road Accident Analysis solution developed using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI to explore accident patterns across the United Kingdom.
This project uncovers trends in casualties, severity levels, vehicle involvement, environmental conditions, and geographic hotspots to support public safety planning, transport operations, and data-driven policy decisions.
Both Excel and Power BI versions offer interactive dashboards enabling users to drill down into severity, road types, light conditions, surface conditions, rural/urban segments, and time-based trends.

📁 **Dataset**
The dataset contains detailed accident and casualty information across multiple dimensions:
•	Casualty Details: Fatal, serious, and slight injuries
•	Vehicle Types: Car, bike, van, bus, agricultural, and others
•	Road Types: Single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout, slip road, one-way street
•	Location & Area: Rural vs Urban distribution
•	Environmental Conditions:
1. Road Surface: Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice
2. Lighting Condition: Daylight vs Darkness
3. Weather Conditions
•	Time Dimensions: Monthly casualty trends for 2021 and 2022

📅 **Analysis Period**: Calendar years 2021 & 2022

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

Data Visualization	-  Excel, Power BI

Data Processing	-  Excel (Power Query)

KPI Calculations	- DAX, Excel formulas

Mapping	- Power BI Map Visual

Dashboarding	- Slicers, PivotTables, Interactive Charts

🔄 **Workflow**

1️⃣ Data Preparation (Excel + Power Query)

•	Cleaned and transformed raw data

•	Standardized date formats, road types, severity labels

•	Created calculated columns for analysis (e.g., YoY and MoM trends)

•	Validated accident counts and casualty categories

2️⃣ Excel Dashboard Development

•	Built interactive dashboard using PivotTables & PivotCharts

•	Added slicers for: Accident Date, Road Type, Vehicle Category, Rural/Urban, Light Condition

•	Implemented trend charts for 2021 vs 2022 casualty comparison

•	Created visual summaries:

✔ Casualties by severity

✔ Vehicle type breakdown

✔ Road-type analysis

✔ Light condition impact

✔ Road surface condition

3️⃣ Power BI Development
•	Built Date Dimension for time intelligence

•	Designed interactive visuals:

✔ Line charts (YoY trends)

✔ Donut & pie charts (severity, vehicle type, light condition)

✔ Stacked bar charts (road surface, road types)

✔ Geographic accident map for hotspot identification

•	Created KPI cards for fatal, serious, slight casualties, and total casualties

•	Added slicers for severity, surface type, weather condition, vehicle type, and location

📈 **Key Insights**

•	Total casualties show a declining YoY trend, but serious and fatal injuries remain notable.

•	Cars and bikes account for the majority of casualties, indicating high exposure risk.

•	Single carriageway roads recorded the highest casualty volume (4.1K+).

•	Daylight conditions accounted for most casualties (4.3K+), suggesting traffic volume as a major factor.

•	Urban areas showed higher incident density compared to rural locations.

•	Poor weather and wet/snow surfaces significantly influence accident severity.

🎯 **Potential Recommendations**

•	Prioritize safety interventions on high-risk road categories (e.g., single carriageways).

•	Focus awareness programs on car and bike users.

•	Enhance lighting, signage, and road markings in high-casualty zones.

•	Improve infrastructure planning and weather-based safety measures.
